# # 777 relationship method: Why I almost planned my divorce over his snoring

> "We were roommates with a mortgage and a shared Netflix password." This is the raw story of how the **777 rules for marriage** saved us when I was ready to walk away.

### The Anniversary of Nothing
My husband forgot our anniversary. Again. 
Not the big one - our wedding anniversary, he remembers that one bc the calendar screams at him. I mean the anniversary of our first fight. The anniversary of the day we moved in together. The anniversary of when he finally admitted he loved me more than his PlayStation.

I know, I know. "Yana, that's not a real anniversary." But to me? Those tiny dates were proof we were paying attention. That we were still choosing each other in the small moments. And he forgot. Again. For the third year in a row.

So I did what any rational, emotionally mature woman would do. I cried in the bathroom, posted a vague sad quote on Instagram, and didn't speak to him for two days. He had no idea why.

This was us. Me, drowning in unspoken expectations. Him, confused and defensive, wondering why I was "suddenly" mad when "nothing happened." We were roommates with a mortgage. Co-parents with a shared Netflix password. We said "I love you" like we were saying "pass the salt" - automatic, empty, routine.

### The Magic Formula?
The night I found myself googling "is my marriage over or just boring," I fell into a rabbit hole. Some article about actors and cheating and this weird thing called the 777 rule. I almost scrolled past. Sounded like another productivity hack for people who color-code their sock drawers.

But I was desperate. So I read it. And I laughed. Out loud. In bed next to my sleeping husband who had no idea I was planning our divorce over his snoring.

Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, a vacation. "That's it?" I thought. "That's the magic formula? Seven is just a number, Karen."

But here's the thing. We hadn't been on a real date in... I don't know. Months? Maybe since our daughter was born four years ago. Dinner with the kids doesn't count when you're cutting up chicken nuggets and talking about poop. So I tried it. Not bc I believed in it. Bc I had nothing left to lose.

### Week one: The date that almost didn't happen
I told him Thursday morning. "We're going out tomorrow. Just us. No phones." He looked at me like I'd suggested we rob a bank. "But Friday is my gaming night with the guys."

I felt the old rage rising. The "you never prioritize me" speech loading in my brain like a gun. But instead, I said: "Cool. What time do they usually start?" "Eight." "Perfect. Dinner at six. Home by seven-thirty. You still get your guys. I get you first."

He agreed. Reluctantly. Like I was asking him to get a root canal. We went to that Italian place on 5th - the one from our early days when we were broke and splitting pasta. I wore lipstick. He wore a shirt without holes. We talked about... actually, I don't remember what we talked about. But I remember he looked at me. Like, really looked. Not past me, not through me, at me.

### Week seven: The night away that exposed everything
Seven weeks later, we left our daughter with my mom. One night. Local hotel. Nothing fancy - we couldn't afford fancy. Just... away. I packed lingerie. He packed his laptop "just in case." I almost canceled right there.

But we went. And in that anonymous room, with no dishes to wash and no kid to wake us, we lay in the dark and talked. Really talked. He admitted he felt like a failure. That my silences scared him. That he didn't know how to fix what he didn't understand was broken.

I admitted I expected him to read my mind. That my "hints" were actually demands wearing disguise. That I stopped asking for what I needed bc I was tired of hearing no. We didn't have sex that night. We just... held hands. Like teenagers. Like people who were scared of losing each other.

### Month seven: The vacation that changed the math
Seven months. Summer. We saved like crazy. Took our daughter to the beach, then shipped her to grandma's for three days. Just us. A tiny Airbnb with a view of nothing special.

But we walked. Ate ice cream for dinner. Talked about whether we wanted another kid (no), whether we should move (maybe), whether we were happy (getting there).

### The Rhythm of Redemption
Here's what I learned. The **777 rules for marriage** aren't about the numbers. Seven is arbitrary. Could be 555. Could be 101010. The number doesn't matter. What matters is the rhythm. The commitment to showing up before the silence becomes permanent. The structure that forces you to prioritize each other before life swallows you whole.

### Final Thoughts
We still fight. Last week he forgot to buy milk and I made it about his entire character. I'm not perfect. Neither is he. But now we have a date every Friday. Sometimes it's fancy, sometimes it's drive-thru tacos in the car. But it's ours.

Every seven weeks, we find a way to sleep somewhere else. Every seven months, we plan something bigger. A memory that belongs to only us.

The **777 rule for couples** was a lifeline. Not bc it's magic. Bc it's a promise written in calendar ink. A way to say "I choose you" when words feel too heavy and silence feels too easy.
